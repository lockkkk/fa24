### Course Overview

This is a graduate-level course that covers advanced topics in data center networking systems. It explores the intersection of computer networking, computer systems, and computer architecture, emphasizing how these traditionally separate domains interact to support large-scale, high-performance communication infrastructures in modern data centers.

The objectives of this course are:

- To understand state-of-the-art network protocols, modern network hardware, and large-scale communication systems.
- Critically evaluate networking research papers and articulate well-informed perspectives and insights.
-  Identify research problems in data-center communication protocols, systems stacks, and network hardware, and explore them through a semester-long project.

The course is structured around lectures by the instructor and paper readings/presentations by the students with open discussion. Students will form a project group (1-3 students) and conduct a research project on networked systems.

### Reference books
