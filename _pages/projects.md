### Overview

The course project is an open-ended research project in networking done in groups of 1-3 people. We will provide a list of project ideas. We also highly encourage you to bring your own ideas.

---

### Project ideas

We will post some ideas [here](#).

---

### Proposal

Describe the project idea/application, how it relates to the course material, what work must be done (suggesting how it can be partitioned among you), and what resources you will need (including software systems you already have access to). Concentrate on convincing us that it will pertain to the course, that you will be able to complete it, and that we will be able to evaluate it. The third page should outline your intended final paper, identifying the specific experiments to run and the questions they will answer.

In your proposal, include three types of goals: 75% goals, 100% goals, and 125% goals. Think of these as the equivalent of a B, an A, and a "wow!" grade. The goals can be dependent or independent of the previous goals.

Please use the ACM HotNets [Latex template](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2024/docs/hotnets24-template.zip) for the proposal.

### Midterm checkpoint meeting

Each project team is required to schedule a checkpoint meeting with the instructor. The purpose of this meeting is to provide an early feedback on your progress to help ensure that your final report is great.

---

### Final report and presentation

Each project team is required to submit a final report and give a presentation at the end of the semester.
The final report should be 6 pages long.

Please use the ACM HotNets [Latex template](https://conferences.sigcomm.org/hotnets/2024/docs/hotnets24-template.zip) for the final report.
